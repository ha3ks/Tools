# CTFScan

- Dan Murray

---------------------

This is the journey I am about to take in building a scanner for CTF boxes.

Yes I could just run nmap and whatnot but since this is a task I do over and over I want to automate it and building a tool is the best bet, this could also help with future engagements and would work as a reference for 'hey I built this and saved X amount of time --HIRE ME!!'

## The Plan

build a basic scanner i.e. 'CTFScan --TARGET' and it will magically scan and enumerate a basic nmap for me and poop it out into a file 'CTFScan_Results.txt'

## Todo
- Google, how else will I learn examples of scanners people have already built.
	- Use an ass load of bash aliases and run one after another/pipe from one to another?
- Build it to do the scan and output (initially anyway, see Dreams section).
- 

## Dreams 
- Brainstorm other things like also run nikto or gobuster for me and make relevant outputs.
- maybe vuln reporting built in?
